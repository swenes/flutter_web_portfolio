# web_portfolio

Welcome to my first foray into web development â€“ a dazzling and responsive Flutter web portfolio! This project is not just a static showcase; It is a dynamic and visually engaging experience that effortlessly adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless presentation on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.<br><br><br> I also inject some creativity with meticulously crafted animations, turning your portfolio into an immersive journey for your visitors.<br>Since this is my first step in the web field, I would be very pleased if we could discuss possible errors in the topics section :) <br><br>
